Under reasonable assumptions on these parameters, the model satisfies appropriate conservation laws, dissipates an entropy, and satisfies an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\$-Theorem. In addition, the model parameters provide the additional flexibility that is used to match simultaneously momentum and temperature relaxation formulas derived from the Boltzmann collision operator for a binary mixture with Coulomb potentials. A numerical method for solving the resulting space-homogeneous kinetic equation is presented and two examples are provided to demonstrate the relaxation of species bulk velocities and temperatures to their equilibrium values.},

  abstract = {The Z-pinch m {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 instability as well as its stabilization by radially sheared axial flow is studied using the nonlinear ideal five-moment twofluid (5M2F) model with an extension of that model to include Braginskii heat and momentum transport. Using the ideal 5M2F model, linear growth rate results are compared with prior work using MHD and Hall MHD. At small normalized wavenumber, 1 {$<$} ka {$<$} 4, where a is the effective pinch radius, 5M2F results agree with Hall MHD within \%20\% in scenarios without radially sheared axial flow. With the sheared flow and focusing on ka {$\frac{1}{4}$} 10/3, agreement with Hall MHD is excellent. In the limit of small ion inertial length, results also match with MHD. A comparison with PIC modeling of shear-free m {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 stability focuses on a plasma scenario based on recent experimental results. In a scan of mode wavenumber, ideal 5M2F results are qualitatively similar to PIC: the growth rate rises to a peak at a moderate wavenumber and declines at a large wavenumber in contrast to MHD results, which show the saturation of the growth rate with the increasing wavenumber rather than a decline. The peak normalized 5M2F growth rate is csA {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1:5, where sA is the Alfv en transit time across the pinch. The peak occurs at normalized wavenumber ka {$\frac{1}{4}$} 10. For comparison, PIC results have a peak growth of csA {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:77 at ka {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5. Including Braginskiibased closure of the 5M2F model does not qualitatively change the ideal results in this particular case. Nonlinear saturation is studied using the 5M2F model with the dissipative Braginskii-based closure in cases with pinch-edge sheared-flow speed equal to half the Alfv en speed. Nonlinear mixing due to the sheared flow yields a quasi-steady state after modest losses of pinch ion inventory and pinch thermal energy, approximately 30\% and 10\%, respectively. 5M2F modeling captures the essential physics of m {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 instability and offers a computationally tractable route to high-fidelity modeling of 3D Z-pinch behavior, including m {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 instability.},

  abstract = {In this work, we examine sheath formation in the presence of bias potentials in the current saturation regime for pulsed power fusion experiments. It is important to understand how the particle and heat fluxes at the wall may impact the wall material and affect electrode degradation. Simulations are performed using the 1X-1V Boltzmann-Poisson system for a proton-electron plasma in the presence of bias potentials ranging from 0 to 10 kV. The results indicate that the sheath near the high potential wall remains generally the same as that of a classical sheath without the presence of a bias potential. However, the sheath near the low potential wall becomes more prominent with a larger potential drop, a significant decrease of electron density, and larger sheath lengths. The spatially constant current density increases to a saturation value with increasing bias potential. The current is dominated by the ions at the low potential wall and by the electrons at the high potential wall. The heat flux increases to a saturation value at the high potential wall and tends to zero at the low potential wall with increasing bias potential. The results trend with theory with differences attributed to the simplified assumptions in the theory and the kinetic effects considered in the simulations. Due to the significant computational cost of a well resolved 1X-2V simulation, only one such simulation is performed for the 5 kV case showing higher current.},

  abstract = {A generalized kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. This framework is implemented as a boundary condition for the continuum kinetic Boltzmann equation. The IIEE model is used to study how emissions affect sheath formation near biased Z-pinch electrodes. 1X-1V (one spatial and one velocity dimension) Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a proton-electron plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 kV to 9 kV. The ions are accelerated to higher energies by the sheath potentials at the electrodes inducing electron emission. The secondary electron yield (SEY), defined as the ratio of the flux of emitted electrons to impacting ions, increases with bias potential at both electrodes, but more significantly at the cathode. Despite the SEY crossing 1 at 7 kV, a classical sheath, rather than a space-charge limited or inverse sheath, forms for all cases. The emitted electrons present as a beam that is accelerated by the sheath potential into the domain resulting in increased electron temperatures due to collisions. For bias potentials greater than 2 kV, the potential difference at the cathode is sufficiently strong for emissive heating to increase the plasma potential compared to emissionless simulations. The emitted electrons increase the current in the domain from 130 kA to 199 kA closely matching the experimental value of 200 kA.},
